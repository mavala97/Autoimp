### Automatic importer  

This project is a automated solution for importing and organising files regarding content creation on youtube. In my personal experience I noticed that my workflow regarding video creation suffered from inconsistency. This program aims to solve these problems by automating this process. 

This project will be documented on my youtube channel where you can follow along with the code. Release of the first video is planned in the month of May 2020.



#### Requirements:

(Part 1)

- As a user `I want` to import videos and photos from a removable storage `so that I` can automatically organise my projects  
    - Acceptance criteria: 
        - The removable storage has to be found automatically

- As a user `I want` to register a project name `so that I` can easily find them later   
    - Acceptance criteria:
        - The name of the project should be given as an argument

- As a user `I want` to have my files organised by date and file-type `so that I` can easily find them later   
    - Acceptance criteria:
        - The media files should be imported into a folder with the following path structure `{root}/{year}/{projectName}` with subfolders `Video/` and `Photo/`

(Part 2)
    
- As a user `I want` to be able to use the program with one simple terminal command `so that I` use the program more intuitively.
    - Acceptance criteria:
        - The terminal command should be structured in the following structure `{import}"{space}"{projectName}`

- As a user `I want` to be able to specify multiple sd-cards `so that I` don't have to change the code every time I want to import from a new volume.
    - Acceptance criteria:
        - Every different sd card name should be specified within the code.
        - The program shouldn't look for files on my SSD's, but only on my sd cards

(Part 3)

- As a user `I want` to be able to automatically transcode screen-recordings `so that I` don't have to use the gui of handbrake to transcode.    
    - Acceptance criteria:   
        - The program should be controllable via one simple terminal command.
        - The transcoded files should be delivered in an export folder.
        - The autoimporter should check the export folder for importing the new screen footage.
        - The original screen-recording files should be backed-up on a specified volume
        
(Part 4)

- As a user `I want` to be able to import and transcode footage from a gui `so that` the program is more user friendly
    - Acceptance criteria:
        - The program should use a simple gui.
        - The program should maintain a database or file with the volumes that are supposed to be scanned.
        - The program should have text fields that can be used to add relevant volumes.
        - The program should have buttons to perform the transcode and import actions.
